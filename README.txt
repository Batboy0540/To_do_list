To-Do List Web Application
A simple web-based To-Do List application built with Flask, Python, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite. This app allows users to add, update, delete, and categorize their tasks. It also includes user authentication for personalized task management.

Features
Task Management: Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
Task Status: Tasks can be categorized by status, such as "pending" or "completed."
User Authentication: Users must sign up and log in to manage their tasks.
Database Integration: SQLite database to store user data and tasks.
User Sessions: Sessions to keep users logged in during their use.
Requirements
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+
Flask
Flask-SQLAlchemy
Flask-Login
SQLite (comes pre-installed with Python)
You can install the necessary Python packages using the following:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables (optional):

bash
Copy code
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development  # Enables debug mode
On Windows:

bash
Copy code
set FLASK_APP=app.py
set FLASK_ENV=development  # Enables debug mode
Initialize the Database:

Run the following command to create the necessary database tables:

bash
Copy code
flask shell
from app import db
db.create_all()
Running the Application
To start the application, run:

bash
Copy code

Key Files
app.py: Contains the main application routes, user authentication logic, and task management functionality.
models.py: Contains SQLAlchemy models for the User and Task tables.
templates/: Stores HTML templates for rendering views (login, register, etc.).
static/: Stores CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
Usage
User Authentication
Users can sign up and log in to manage their tasks. Once logged in, users can:

Add tasks: Each task can be given a title and description.
Update tasks: Change the status of tasks (e.g., "pending" or "completed").
Delete tasks: Remove tasks from the list.
Logout: Users can log out at any time.
Task Management
Tasks can be added, updated, or deleted. The task list can be filtered based on the task status (e.g., "completed" or "pending").

Technologies Used
Flask: Micro web framework for Python, used to build the backend.
SQLAlchemy: ORM for interacting with the SQLite database.
Flask-Login: Extension for user session management.
SQLite: Database for storing user and task information.
